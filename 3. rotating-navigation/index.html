        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <small>Chiara Mapelli</small>
        <p>I was born in Italy and I moved to London after school, just before I turned 19. I decided to study Arabic and International Relations at the University of Westminster, and then I got my Master's degree in Middle Eastern Studies, from SOAS University of London. So what about tech, you might ask?</p>

        <h3>Tech & I</h3>

        <p> I decided to move from London to Manchester, as I needed some relatively less expensive place to make my actual home. After four amazing years in the capital, I moved to Manchester in the glorious summer of 2018! I enrolled into a bootcamp just because I wanted to try something new in my life, I suppose.
            I realised that policy and government work was just not for me, as I didn't believe that I could make any sort of actual impact or even small change.
            After a few months I started my first dev job at Kalibrate as a junior developer! I worked on the pricing product which in built in AngularJS and C#, and that uses a SQL Database.
            A year later, I find myself working on the planning product instead, which is built in React and Kotlin, and that uses ElasticSearch as its main database.
